# JJP Contact Integration - Deployment Fixes Required

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Found

The comprehensive testing of https://justpeople1.netlify.app revealed that only the main page is accessible. The contact management and CRM functionality are returning 404 errors.

## ðŸ”§ Immediate Fixes Required

### 1. Check React Router Configuration

The application likely has routing issues. Check the following:

**File:** `src/App.tsx` or main router file
```typescript
// Ensure these routes are properly defined:
<Route path="/contacts" element={<ContactsPage />} />
<Route path="/admin/crm" element={<CRMDashboard />} />
```

### 2. Verify Netlify Redirect Rules

**File:** `public/_redirects`
```
/* /index.html 200
```

This should already exist in the project. If not, add it.

### 3. Check Build Configuration

**File:** `package.json`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### 4. Verify Component Imports

Check that all required components are properly imported:

**Missing Components (likely):**
- `ContactsPage` component
- `CRMDashboard` component
- `ContactImporter` component

### 5. Check for Build Errors

Run locally and check for build errors:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then test these URLs locally:
- http://localhost:5173/contacts
- http://localhost:5173/admin/crm
