## Issues Identified

### 1. Build Failures

- Error: "Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2"
- Likely cause: TypeScript/compilation errors in recent commits

### 2. Missing Contact Integration Features
- Contact data files (CSV/JSON) are not being deployed
- Dashboard routes are not accessible (404 errors)
- Contact import functionality not available

### 3. Deployment Pipeline Issues
- Automatic deployments from GitHub are failing
- Manual build triggers also fail
- No successful deployments in 3+ days

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Build Issues**
   - Review and fix TypeScript compilation errors
   - Check for missing dependencies or configuration issues
   - Ensure all imports and paths are correct

2. **Contact Data Deployment**
   - Ensure CSV/JSON files are included in the build process
   - Add files to the `public` directory or configure proper asset handling

3. **Routing Configuration**
   - Verify React Router configuration
   - Ensure client-side routing works with Netlify's SPA settings
   - Add `_redirects` file for proper SPA routing

4. **Test Integration**
   - Once build issues are resolved, run the deployed site validation tests
   - Verify all contact integration features work properly

### Next Steps

1. **Debug Build Process**
   - Access Netlify build logs to identify specific error
   - Fix compilation/build errors
   - Test local build process

2. **Redeploy with Fixes**
   - Commit build fixes to main branch
   - Monitor deployment success
   - Run comprehensive testing

3. **Verify Contact Features**
   - Test contact import functionality
   - Verify CRM dashboard access
   - Confirm data file accessibility

## Current Status Summary

- **Main Site**: ✅ OPERATIONAL (basic functionality)
- **Contact Features**: ❌ NOT ACCESSIBLE
- **Build Pipeline**: ❌ FAILING
- **Data Files**: ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
- **Test File**: ✅ UPLOADED TO REPO

The JustPeople application is currently serving a basic version from July 12th, but the advanced contact integration features are not accessible due to build failures and missing files in the deployment.
